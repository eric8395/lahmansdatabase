# An Exploration Into Using Lahmans Database

I have been developing some queries in the Lahman's database using MySQL and a sample of queries are found in the repository. 

The [Lahman's Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics) is a collection of historical baseball statistics since 1871. The database is updated yearly following the end of each successive baseball season. 

For example, we can pull up pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics tables for Major League Baseball. The data definitions for each table and columns within the tables can be found in the below link:
